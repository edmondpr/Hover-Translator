# Hover Translator - Google Chrome Extension
## Philip Braunstein

### Introduction
21st Century foreign language learners are at an immense advantage because of the vast availability of foreign language content available on the web. Language learners benefit from reading online newspapers and similar material in their language of choice. 

There are existing translation tools available such as the Google Translate Google Chrome extension. The Google Translate Extension is lacking in that a user must highlight the word of interest with the mouse and then click on a button to get the translation. In an article with many words that a user doesnâ€™t know, this grows tiresome for the language learner.

The Chrome extension packaged here automatically translates the word underneath the cursor from German into English. This allows for an easier more seamless reading of German online texts.

### Use
Install the extension into Chrome.

### Caveats
This extension is invasive by necessity by wrapping all text elements in SPAN elements. This unavoidably breaks certain parts of websites. It works best with sites with HTML as plain as possible.

### Acknowledgments
I am grateful to [Yandex Translate](https://translate.yandex.com/) for keeping their translate API free and easy to use.

### Ongoing Development
1. Add on/off switch to extension so that it can be disabled more easily than diving into Chrome settings.
